Careers in the Creative Arts - Content
===============

These files contain the content for a class project. The project is to create a web site for a fictitous event named Careers in the Creative Arts at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. 

While the event is not real, the speakers are and so is the college. 

These files are just the text and image content for the site. The folders roughly represent the pages on the site. **Do not** recreate the folder structure when you are creating your site. Instead start with making a page for each folder like:

* Home
* Schedule
* Sessions
* Speakers
* About
* Videos

You are going to be able to modify this a bit if you like but the overall content will need to remain.

Because the folder structure of this repository won't be the same as for your project I suggest NOT forking this but instead using the content to make a repository of your own. That should have a typical web structure with a main folder and then folders for css, images, js etc.
